# CS-330-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

<b>How do I approach designing software?</b> I definately feel more comforatable approaching softwared design from the big picture functionality perspective first<br>
<b>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</b> I have worked with 2d print design and graphics for over 20 years and this was my first experience with 3d graphics. This is a whole new world and I look forward to developing this skill more.<br>
<b>What design process did you follow for your project work?</b> I worked from existing code and used it as a template to create my own object and environment. I feel like I am a very visual learner and learn best by example.<br>
<b>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</b> I liked the structure of this program and the organization that keeps it very functional and easy to modify and follow.<br>
<b>How do I approach developing programs?</b> I try to find the best logic to follow and try to keep it very efficient, concise and clean.<br>
<b>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</b> These were whole new components to work with in programming so I spent the majority of my time working to get familar with working in the environment.<br>
<b>How did iteration factor into your development?</b> The iterative approach made it easier to use objects as modules and easily make changes as needed.<br>
<b>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</b> It took some time for me to see how the different components worked together. After seeing how the objects, position, texture, and lighting relate to one another in the enivronement is was easier for me to work toward my final scene.<br>
<b>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? / How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? / How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</b><br>
Classes like this one have introduced me to a whole new world of possiblities and creativity than can be used to drive my educational and professional pathway.
